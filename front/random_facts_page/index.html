        <ol>
            <li>There are over 129 million books in existence.
                <p>As per Google's records, the number of published books stood at <b>129,864,880 million</b> by 2010. This figure has undoubtedly increased since then. Therefore, when expressing frustration about not finding a good book to read, remember the vast array of options available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The most expensive book ever purchased was sold for $30.8 million.
                <p>The most expensive book ever purchased is the <b>Codex Leicester</b> by Leonardo da Vinci, which was acquired by Bill Gates for $30.8 million in 1994. This historic manuscript is named after Thomas Coke, the Earl of Leicester, who purchased it in the 18th century. The Codex Leicester is one of Leonardo's most renowned scientific journals, containing his meticulous observations, diagrams, and theories on a wide range of subjects.</p>

            <li>There’s a word for loving the smell of old books.
                <p>Indeed, there is a word for loving the smell of old books: <b>bibliosmia</b>. Bibliosmia is the appreciation or enjoyment of the unique scent that emanates from aging books. This aroma is often described as a blend of paper, ink, and sometimes even a hint of mustiness, evoking a sense of nostalgia and reverence for the printed word.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Author’s names didn’t used to be printed on the covers of their books.
                <p>The covers of the first printed books were considered <b>artworks</b>. They were covered in drawings, leather and even gold — so there wasn’t a place for the author’s name.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The three most read books in the world are…
                <p>The Holy Bible, Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, and Harry Potter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The word "bookworm"
                <p>Here's a fun fact: The word <b>"bookworm"</b> to describe someone who loves to read actually has a biological origin. Bookworms are small insects that bore into the pages of books, feeding on the paper and glue. In the past, when books were primarily made of organic materials like parchment and leather, bookworms were a common pest, causing damage to precious manuscripts. So, the term "bookworm" originally referred to these literal insects before evolving to describe avid readers who voraciously devour books.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Illiteracy is still a huge problem throughout the world.
                <p>According to UNESCO, approximately <b>773 million</b> adults worldwide lack basic literacy skills, with the majority of them concentrated in developing countries. Illiteracy not only limits individuals' access to information and opportunities but also hinders economic development and perpetuates cycles of poverty.</p>
